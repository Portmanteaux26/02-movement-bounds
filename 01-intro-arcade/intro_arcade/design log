- adding scaling difficulty:
  - first pass was additional enemy spawn on every coin collect event
    This was an improvement, and served goal, but a little to frantic too quickly
  - next test was additional enemy spawn every 5 coins
    An improvement over previous, felt like a good ramp of tension
  - next test was additional enemy spawn every 10 coins
    This felt a little too slow; difficulty felt a little stale by coins 8 or 9
  Locked in adding an enemy every 5 coins.

- adding new enemy type (seekers):
  - initial spawn behavior was every 10 coins collected
    So every 5th coin spawns a bouncer, every 10th a seeker
    This felt good immediately, small difficult ramp on %5, much bigger on %10 coins
  - initial behavior was to redirect to player's current pos whenever touching a wall
    This also felt fun immediately, will experiment with different behaviors in later updates though
  - initial speed was same as bouncers
    This felt way too slow, felt like just another bouncer in most cases
  - increase speed to match player
    This felt much better, gave the seeker a much more defined identity
    Adjusted seeker and bouncer sizes to further differentiate them
- adding lives system
  - inital value of 3
    Feels good so far, will investigate possible invulnerability period in future updates
