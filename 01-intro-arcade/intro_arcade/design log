- adding scaling difficulty:
  - first pass was additional enemy spawn on every coin collect event
    This was an improvement, and served goal, but a little to frantic too quickly
  - next test was additional enemy spawn every 5 coins
    An improvement over previous, felt like a good ramp of tension
  - next test was additional enemy spawn every 10 coins
    This felt a little too slow; difficulty felt a little stale by coins 8 or 9
  Locked in adding an enemy every 5 coins.
